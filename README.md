# Ashley_MockUp_Store
 Using APIs from Printful and Sandbox Chase, I want to create my own storefront.

 Resources
 1. 20486D - Developing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Applications - Module 13 Implementing Web APIs - Lesson 3
 2. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/advanced/calling-a-web-api-from-a-net-client -- I used the product class layout as a start for my own product class
 3. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/naming/directory/package-summary.html - JAVAX seemed required from one of my resources and this is what came up when I looked into it. It seems more java based, so I probably don't need this information. 
   
   The website I was looking at was the Printful API documentaion: https://www.printful.com/docs/index
   This is where it mentioned the Authorization attribute. ASP.NET seems to have the Authorize attributes. So, I need to see how they are similar or if I can use both since Visual Studio recongized and tried to correct the problem with a using statement. 
   Next Goals
   1. Finish setting up
   2. Test to see if I can recieve the information from the API
